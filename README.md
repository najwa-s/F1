# 🏎️ F1 Analysis Dashboard 

Welcome to the F1 Data Analysis Dashboard!
This project is a personal tribute to my passion for Formula 1, combining my love for racing with my enthusiasm for data and coding.
Here, I dive deep into race telemetry, lap times, pit stops, tire strategies, and much more, offering an interactive dashboard to explore and visualize key race insights.

⚡ Whether you're an F1 fan or a data enthusiast (or both like me!), this project brings the excitement of Grand Prix weekends to life through data.






# ❤️ Why This Project?
Formula 1 is not just a sport for me — it's a passion.
The speed, the strategy, the drama — every Grand Prix weekend feels like a story unfolding in real-time.
Through this project, I wanted to combine my two biggest interests: technology and racing, and create a space where data meets adrenaline. 🏎️📊

This is my small way of celebrating the beauty and complexity of Formula 1, and hopefully, sharing that excitement with others!

# GUIDE 

First you clone the project :

```
git clone https://github.com/najwa-s/F1.git
```

After that : 

You create a folder named data where it's going to fetch the data and put it in that directory. To do that, you have to do the following :

This will put you in the project (F1 is the name of the project, but it can be named differently)
```
cd F1 
```

and then make the directory 'data'

```
mkdir data
```

After that, you install all the requirements 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


And then you can run the project with the following command :

```
python main.py
```
