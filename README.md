# 🏎️ F1 Analysis Dashboard 

Welcome to the F1 Data Analysis Dashboard!
This project is a personal tribute to my passion for Formula 1, combining my love for racing with my enthusiasm for data and coding.
Here, I dive deep into race telemetry, lap times, pit stops, tire strategies, and much more, offering an interactive dashboard to explore and visualize key race insights.

⚡ Whether you're an F1 fan or a data enthusiast (or both like me!), this project brings the excitement of Grand Prix weekends to life through data.
